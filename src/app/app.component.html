      <p>Google sheet has three parts "About, Hex Journal and Charts". The "about page" explains terms, formulas and
        notes on how to use Hex Journal. The "About" page shows a detail account on how to use this sheet. Sections
        with the color table in "note" makes it simple to organize the data. There is a explanation on how to use
        the columns and rows in a number format.</p>

      <h2>2</h2><img src="assets/image/test3.png" alt="help">
      <p>The sheet can expand and contract vertically and horizontally . There are 55 columns with 15 data entries
        that can be filled for optimizations. The table is divided into 3 sections. the first part extents from 1 to
        19 with two expansions which deal which the Hex product. The first sections displays t-shares Hex operations
        and Hex price. Your t-shares is like a factory thats keeps producing more of itself, the more t-shares you
        own the more Hex interest you gain. The only input needed to tract your t-shares is the number the user
        writes in column 1,8. This number method avoids the exposure of your contract address by converting it into
        a number formate. The first expansion shows your personal t-shares performance (1-8).</p>

        share rate shows that HEX share rate increases over time making it impossible to outperform long-term
        staking with a strategy of frequent
        short-time staking. Column 14 is total staking in pool with column 15 as allocated supply and the rest
        follows as the collective percentage in the staking pool. The last columns 45-55 is a simulation of
        hypotheticals with 4 entry points. In column "AU18" you can experiment with APY which collects data from
        "AU5".Put number of t-shares you desire to speculate with and write number of days in column"AU18". There
        are terms and definitions with a overview of charts far right.</p>
